\subsection*{Reminder of Course Policy}

\begin{itemize}
    \item The use of GenAI tools (e.g., ChatGPT, Grammarly, Bard) for completing any part of this course is discouraged.
    \item Using these tools is not needed to be successful in the class and could be detrimental to your learning experience.
    \item If you use them, you must cite the tool you used and explain how you used it.
    \item If you do not cite the tool, it is an academic code violation.
    \item We will be using special tools to detect cases of unattributed GenAI use.

    \item 
    \begin{enumerate}[(i)] 
        \item \textbf{[2 points]}
Below is some code that sets pixels that have a value of 50 or less to 0. This removes some of the lower-intensity haze around the bright lights. However, the code only works on single-channel grayscale images.

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=orange!5!white,colframe=orange!75!black]
Using another for loop and other appropriate modifications, convert the following code to work on \href{run:images/grizzlypeak-color.png}{grizzlypeak-color.png} (also in the images folder).

You can paste the code in a Python file to run it. Make sure the conda env is activated.

\textbf{[1 points]} Let's find the time it takes to run this operation once. Because a single short task on multitasking computers often takes variable time, we can record how long code execution takes on a small number of images and then average the execution time.

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=orange!5!white,colframe=orange!75!black]
Record how long it takes to execute 10 times. How long does it take to change the pixel values once? Please include your code.
\end{tcolorbox}

\emph{Note: } When measuring the time, please ignore the file loading. You should only time the image modification itself.

\item \textbf{[3 points]} Let's say we want to run our image modification 1000 times. If we used our current implementation, it would be slow. Why might that be? We think we can find a faster solution.

\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
\item \textbf{[2 point]}
\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=orange!5!white,colframe=orange!75!black] 
Using logical indexing (see the Python tutorial), find a faster solution to remove the haze.

Now, using your optimized solution, record how long it takes to change the pixel values 1000 times. How long does the new code take to change the pixel values on one image? How much faster is the new version per image, as a
multiplicative factor (eg: 2×, 5×)? Please include your code.

\paragraph{Q6:} \textbf{[3 points]}

The debugger within VSCode is an important tool you can use to discover potential bugs in the code that you write.

Imagine our task is to create a crop of an image that starts at the center of the image and extends to the lower right corner of the image. If all goes well, we should only see content from the lower right region of the original image.

\emph{Image:} \href{images/gigi.jpg}{gigi.jpg} (in images folder)

\begin{python}
from skimage import io
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

origImage = io.imread('./images/gigi.jpg')
(height, width, channels) = origImage.shape
startCropX = width % 2
startCropY = height % 2
croppedImage = origImage[startCropY:, startCropX:]

plt.imshow(croppedImage)
plt.show()
\end{python}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=orange!5!white,colframe=orange!75!black,enhanced jigsaw,breakable,pad at break*=1mm]
Create a new python file in the same directory as the image, and copy in the above code block. Then, open the file in VSCode, and execute the code within a debugging session by pressing F5 (or `Run $\rightarrow$ Start Debugging'). At the prompt, we wish to `Debug the currently active Python file'.

The output is not currently what we want, so let's stop execution and then identify the bug in this program:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item First, set a breakpoint at line 7 and then re-execute the code within a debugging session.
    \item Inspect the `startCropX' variable either by looking at the left-hand Variables panel, or by mouse hovering over the variable in the text editor. What should it be?
    \item Execute line 7 of code by `stepping over' the current line (F10, or `Run $\rightarrow$ Step Over). We should now be about to execute line 8.
    \item Inspect `startCropY' and verify its correctness.
\end{enumerate}

At this point, you might have an idea of how to fix the code. But, before stopping execution and editing the file, let's test out our hypothesis in the `Debug Console' during debugging.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Switch to the Debug Console by pressing CTRL-SHIFT-Y (or `View $\rightarrow$ Debug Console') --- you should see it in the bottom right of the display screen.
    \item \emph{This is an interactive Python console with access to working memory.} As a test, print out the value of `width'. Perform a mathematical operation on `width'.
    \item Assign the right value to `startCropX' within the Debug Console. Notice how the value updated in the Variables panel.
    \item Do the same for `startCropY'.
    \item From this point, execute the rest of the code by Continuing beyond our current paused position in the code. Press F5 to Continue (or `Run $\rightarrow$ Continue').
\end{enumerate}

Re-execute the debugger, and capture a screenshot showing your use of the Debug Console and inspection of a variable. Also, write the correct code below.

\paragraph{Q7:} \textbf{[3 points]} This program should print out the maximum value in the matrix obtained by multiplying a random non-square matrix with its transpose.

Here, we're using some numpy functions that may be new to us, but they each have self-explanatory names.

\begin{python}
import numpy as np
from numpy import random as r

mat_1 = r.rand(200,150)
mat_2 = mat_1
np.transpose(mat_2)
mat_3 = np.matmul(mat_1, mat_2)
mat_max = np.max(mat_3)

print("Max value:", mat_max)
\end{python}

This time, when we execute the code, it will raise an exception.

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=orange!5!white,colframe=orange!75!black]
Run the code in a debugging session, note the exception, and inspect the variables. Form a hypothesis for the error, set a breakpoint before it, and use the Debug Console to test that it prevents the exception. 
\end{tcolorbox}

\emph{Hint: Remember rules about matrix multiplication. What should the dimensions of each matrix be? Use the debugger to notice how the shapes of the images do or do not change.}

Capture a screenshot of your session showing us the issue and paste the correct code.
